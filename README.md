## Issues as of Nov 21

- sometimes tools disappear altogether while drawing
- sometimes the save button/color options disappear while drawing
- it appears not to have saved items
- You can zoom in rather close, but when you attempt to draw at the closest zoom level, it backs out to a further point.  
    If possible, can the drawing tools be used at the closest zoom level to get the accuracy we need?

----
- *OK!* We discussed locking this into overhead view, not skewed
